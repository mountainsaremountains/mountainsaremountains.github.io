<p><i>Before I had studied Zen for thirty years, I saw mountains as
mountains, and waters as waters. When I arrived at a more intimate
knowledge, I came to the point where I saw that mountains are not
mountains, and waters are not waters. But now that I have got its very
substance I am at rest. For it's just that I see mountains once again
as mountains, and waters once again as waters.</i> <br> &mdash; Ch'uan Teng Lu,
22. (The Way of Zen 126) </p>

<p> The journey to understanding any subject is one that requires
motivation and study.  I have spent over ten years studying physics.
I am here to help you on your path to understanding physics.  I
approach problems by relating difficult concepts to experiences we
all have.  I help students when they get stuck by asking questions so
they can find the answer.  Once the answer is found, I help students
check it to make sure that it is correct.  This process is essential
to developing a full and deep understanding of physics.  </p>

            with students at any level in their physics education. My

      <p> My hourly tutoring rate is $50 per hour. That hour includes
      55 minutes of tutoring and 5 minutes to check in about progress
      and scheduling. I’m not able to stay longer than 60 minutes
      unless otherwise arranged. If I need to travel more than 30
      minutes, I charge $65 per hour to cover time and gas traveling.
      The contact person agrees to pay my tutoring fee in advance or
      at the beginning of the tutoring session. </p>

	<h3> Tutor Expectations </h3>
<p>I prepare lessons for students by discussing with the student to
tailor a program that will most benefit the student.  Most of the time
this means preparing problems that follow a course syllabus, but can
include reviewing past material depending on student interest or
ability. Occasionally lessons will include a significant portion for
the student to ask questions about past material or help with homework
problems that are not graded for a course. </p>

<p>I structure my lessons around having the student solve problems. Much
of physics is learned by working through problems, and my tutoring
sessions are no different.  I emphasize techniques over memorizing
formulas.  I work with students and guide them to the solution through
question and answer.  This is in contrast to a lecture hall where the
results are presented as if by magic, and the reasoning is sometimes
glossed over.  This is however time intensive, and sometimes it can
require multiple sessions to cover a topic if the student is
struggling with a particular concept.</p>

<h3> Student Expectations </h3>
<p>I expect that students arrive on time and ready to learn. If a
student arrives late, I charge half the hourly rate until the student
arrives (or the entire rate if the student is a no-show). </p>

<p>Every student is different and arrives at a different level.  I
recognize this and adjust my tutoring strategy accordingly.  At times
I prepare more material than can be covered in the time.  In that case
I send the student home with the extra material and cover it again the
next week. I work with students to prepare study guides for upcoming
tests and finals.  This is for the students benefit, and if time
permits I will look over student solutions in order to assess
progress. </p>


<h3>Cancellation Policy</h3>
<p>You may cancel your tutoring session with no penalty up to 24 hours
before the scheduled session. If, however, you cancel within 24 hours
of the session, payment is due in full. To cancel an appointment, you
can call, email or text my cell phone. </p>

<h3>Guarantee/Liability</h3>
<p>I provide no guarantees of my tutoring services whatsoever as far as
performance on exams quizzes or homework. The reason being that
performance is based solely on the student's hard work and investment
in the material.</p>
